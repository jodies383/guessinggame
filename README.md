# Mini Widgets

Here are some Mini Widgets we will use to refresh your DOM web development skills.
## Guessing game

Create a guessing game that gives users the chance to guess a number between 1 and 100.

If the guess is too low show : `Your guess is too low`
Or if too high show the message `Your guess is too high`
If the correct number is guessed show this message: `Correct, the secret number is ${number}`.

A new number should be generated 5 seconds after a successfull guess.

Show a message stating: `New game started!` I should stay on the screen for 3 seconds.

If the widget is refreshed a new secret number is created.

Create a random secret number using `let randomNumber = Math.ceil((Math.random() * 100))`
